-=-= Next Steps =-=-
Build a simple organism (initially non-evolving) to control bodies
Hook phenotypes into organisms
Hook virtual hardware into organisms
Create a world object
Hook proper config into system
Setup mutations
Setup "optional" plug-in-like module.
  - Each module should include:
    * a code-header with new code
    * a config-header with setting macros
    * a run-time config file
  - Each header should have a Setup() method that takes in the current world and hooks in
    relevant functions.  This should only be called if the associated run-time config is included.

-=-= Needed Fixes =-=-
* Make sure keypresses that are not reacted to are passed back to the browser.

-=-= Efficiency notes =-=-
* Integers may be sufficiently faster than doubles that we should consider switching the
  physics to fixed-point ints.
* Pause animation if nothing is happening in physics?
  Find some other speedup mechanism to not process physics?
* Try images instead of circles in viewer to see if it's faster.

-=-= For CSE 450 =-=-
* Bodies should be able to fire missles
