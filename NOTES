* Make sure keypresses that are not reacted to are passed back to the browser.

-=-= Efficiency notes =-=-
* Integers may be sufficiently faster than doubles that we should consider switching the
  physics to fixed-point ints.
* Pause animation if nothing is happening in physics?
  Find some other speedup mechanism to not process physics?
* Try images instead of circles in viewer to see if it's faster.
