-=-= Next Steps =-=-
Setup timing to use Emscripten run instead of animation.
Change reproduction button to toggel whether orgs are replicating on their own.
Make reproduction slow down under pressure (to minimize popping)
Setup proper body info types (For color, CPUs, Markov Brains, etc.)
Build base classes for bodies?
Make physics always double-based.
Move viewer from Kinetic to straight canvas
Setup a few simple on-screen data trackers (e.g., pop size)
Make sure organisms can be linked to more than one other organism
Build a simple organism (initially non-evolving) to control bodies
Hook phenotypes into organisms
Hook virtual hardware into organisms
Create a world object
Hook proper config into system
Setup mutations
Setup "optional" plug-in-like module.
  - Each module should include:
    * a code-header with new code
    * a config-header with setting macros
    * a run-time config file
  - Each header should have a Setup() method that takes in the current world and hooks in
    relevant functions.  This should only be called if the associated run-time config is included.

-=-= Needed Fixes =-=-
* Make sure keypresses that are not reacted to are passed back to the browser.

-=-= Efficiency notes =-=-
* Integers may be sufficiently faster than doubles that we should consider switching the
  physics to fixed-point ints.
* Pause animation if nothing is happening in physics?
  Find some other speedup mechanism to not process physics?
* Try images instead of circles in viewer to see if it's faster.

-=-= For CSE 450 =-=-
* Bodies should be able to fire missles
